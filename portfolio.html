    <p>Hi! My name's Dom. I'm a Game Dev (arguably so, I've never actually
      released anything very worthwhile) who has been passionate about making games
      ever since 2019, where I began learning programming through Java and Python and began learning pixel art and other forms of digital art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I mainly write games using Gamemaker Studio and Godot, but I am somewhat familiar
      with Unreal Engine and Unity.

              <p>I began this project in Godot after viewing a video by Brandon James Greer, <a href="https://youtu.be/133Qk9kVyVA">in particular this one.</a> 
                I liked the idea of a 3d platformer game like Mario or Kirby in the style of an older 2d platformer and so I prototyped this demo with this little character. The sprite is a billboard sprite
                (similar to way enemies were rendered in the original DOOM and Wolfenstein games) which changes what direction sprite is being used by adding the direction of the
                camera and the player's direction (plus some orientation tweaking) and applying it to an animation blendspace which transitions the sprite from there. The end result
                is a good mix between a 2d style and 3d perspective that I was aiming for. My main goal for the controls was polishing the movement, making sure that it felt as fun to play with as possible.
                I'd like to flesh out this game some more, potentially figuring out some gameplay mechanics to add to it (I tried a dash feature, however it was not fun to control
                in 3d) I believe this could turn into something great if I put enough effort into it!!

              <br> This is a multiplayer game using Gamemaker's Rollback multiplayer system, which allows multiplayer games to be made really easily (granted, they have to be uploaded through
              GX games if they want to be multiplayer though). The main idea behind it was to create a sort of capture the flag game, but other projects got in the way and I never got around to
              finishing it. I'd love to work on it more, though, next time I have a considerable amount of free time.

              <p>Some context: While Gamemaker does have a particle system, it is really really simple and can barely interact with, well, really anything. Which really sucks for me. I wanna see
              particles do stuff! Collide! Bounce! Et Cetera! So I made this. Each particle is its own object (very unoptimised, but for a proof of concept it's okay enough) with a really basic
              home-made physics solver (Basic Gravity, friction and drag. That's all.) but the results are awesome! Shooting walls makes debris fly off of walls and bounce off others, very fun.
              I've thought of ways to incorporate these particles into some sort of gameplay, but I think they'll remain as a cool effect.

              <p><b>NOTE: This is not anything I'm proud of, on a technical level. I can do much better than this game now, but there is a story behind it which I think is important to share.</b>
              <br> This "game" is the very very very first thing I ever actually "finished", which is easy to see why with how simple it is. I don't know exactly what compelled me to make it, 
              but it was something along the lines of a Gamemaker Project where I wanted to make an object spawn upon pressing the mouse down, but I accidentally put the code in the mouse down
              event rather than the mouse pressed one, meaning an object would spawn every frame. The result was a pen sort of feature. Anyway, all I did to "finish" it was add a way to clear
              the screen and that was that. I shared it with my friends and moved on with my life, thinking I had made a pretty cool little drawing tool and that was it. <br>
              Jump to a few months later, and I discover that some of my friends were using it to draw things (for example, someone drew a tree and used it for a group chat icon). <br>
              That moment, when I got to see something <i>I</i> made be appreciated by others, was the moment I fell in love with creating games. And since then, I haven't lost any passion at
              all.

              This single platformer game is the largest and most labour-intensive thing I have ever made, like, EVER. I started it back in 2021 (I think) as a quick little month long project
              I could pump out for a special occasion. However, scope creep hit and I decided to turn it into a fully-fledged thing. Features in the game include (Note also, Gamemaker Studio
              does not have a lot of these features built in, so I had to make them myself):
              <li>A menu system with multiple layers and settings,</li>
              <li>Player selection,</li>
              <li>Branching dialogues which depend on the character you have selected,</li>
              <li>A cutscene system,</li>
              <li>NPCs with unique AIs,</li>
              <li>And a world map featuring an Earthbound-style follow system.</li>
              And the best part of all of this? <i>I never plan on releasing this publicly.</i> All of this work I am doing for fun and to tell a story for my friends and my friends only. This 
              is why I'm not gunna talk about it much here. <a href="#contact">But if you really do want to learn more, here's how you can contact me!</a>
