    <p>Hi! My name's Dom. I'm a Game Dev (arguably so, I've never actually
      released anything very worthwhile) who has been passionate about making games
      ever since 2019, where I began learning programming through Java and Python and began learning pixel art and other forms of digital art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I mainly write games using Gamemaker Studio and Godot, but I am somewhat familiar
      with Unreal Engine and Unity.

      <p>This is a list of some of my best game making or other programming projects, in no particular order. Most were made with Gamemaker Studio 2 or Godot. Download links (.exe only, sorry) and Github repos can be found with each project.</p>

              <p>I began this project in Godot after viewing a video by Brandon James Greer, <a href="https://youtu.be/133Qk9kVyVA">in particular this one.</a> 
                I liked the idea of a 3d platformer game like Mario or Kirby in the style of an older 2d platformer and so I prototyped this demo with this little character. The sprite is a billboard sprite
                (similar to way enemies were rendered in the original DOOM and Wolfenstein games) which changes what direction sprite is being used by adding the direction of the
                camera and the player's direction (plus some orientation tweaking) and applying it to an animation blendspace which transitions the sprite from there. The end result
                is a good mix between a 2d style and 3d perspective that I was aiming for. My main goal for the controls was polishing the movement, making sure that it felt as fun to play with as possible.
                I'd like to flesh out this game some more, potentially figuring out some gameplay mechanics to add to it (I tried a dash feature, however it was not fun to control
                in 3d) I believe this could turn into something great if I put enough effort into it!!

              <p><b>NOTE: This is not anything I'm proud of, on a technical level. I can do much better than this game now, but there is a story behind it which I think is important to share.</b>
              <br> This "game" is the very very very first thing I ever actually "finished", which is easy to see why with how simple it is. I don't know exactly what compelled me to make it, 
              but it was something along the lines of a Gamemaker Project where I wanted to make an object spawn upon pressing the mouse down, but I accidentally put the code in the mouse down
              event rather than the mouse pressed one, meaning an object would spawn every frame. The result was a pen sort of feature. Anyway, all I did to "finish" it was add a way to clear
              the screen and that was that. I shared it with my friends and moved on with my life, thinking I had made a pretty cool little drawing tool and that was it. <br>
              Jump to a few months later, and I discover that some of my friends were using it to draw things (for example, someone drew a tree and used it for a group chat icon). <br>
              That moment, when I got to see something <i>I</i> made be appreciated by others, was the moment I fell in love with creating games. And since then, I haven't lost any passion at
              all.
